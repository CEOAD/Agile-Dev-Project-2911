## Introduction

This weather app was created by BCIT ACIT Term 1 and 2 students in Spring 2023 as part of the Agile project development course ACIT 2911.
The course was designed to give ACIT students the experience of building an application using Agile development principles. The weather app
allows users to check the weather and other information at a location and 3 nearby cities. It also allows users to save their favourite places
via implementing account features and authentication. The app is also integrated with Circle CI for continuous integration/deployment.
